Figure 1: Each analyzed PDB has a mutation on one of the positions shown in A, either on the heavy-chain (prefixed by 'H')
or the light-chain  (prefixed by 'L'), while B shows how represented is each kind of mutation on the dataset.
Edge weights show the number of times each mutation shows up on the data set and the node colores reflects the hydrophobicity index of the amino acid.
